## CONTRIBUTING

* Fork the project, taking care not to get any in your eyes.

* Make your feature addition or bug fix.

* Add tests for it.

* Commit, but do not mess with the Rakefile, VERSION, or history. If you want
  to have your own version, that is fine, but bump version in a commit by
  itself so that I can ignore it when I pull.

* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches. But we all know
  everything is made up and the points don't matter... right?
